Trading strategy (conceptual level):
simple break out strategy
	looks at past highs of a given instrument, generates a buy signal as soon as the price manages to break out from its previous high. 
	After buying the secuiruty we want to send out a trading stop loss that follows the price upwards. As long as  the price continues
	to rise upwards our stop loss will do so aswell. But as soon as it drops more than a certain amount the position will be closed.
	The idea behind this trading stop loss is to cut our losers short and let the winner run. 

When developing trading algortihms it is very important to be very precise with what you want.

Identifying a price breakout is not simple for a bot.

We have to specify how a breakout is defined for our strategy to work.
Easy approach is to say that we look at the closing prices for the last 3 months and whatever price is the highest 
is our breakout level. 

Why do we look at 3months?
We want our algorithm to have a dynamic approach: volatility adjusted lookback length 
Dynamically determine how far it looks back for a breakout level based on the secuitys volatility. If volatility is high then we want to look further into the past when volatility is relativility low.

 Summary:
Strategy is: Simple breakout strategy, that dynamically changes its lookback length. It uses a trading stop loss to protect against potential losses.
